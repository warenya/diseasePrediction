# Disease Prediction
A robust machine learning model to predict diseases in humans based on symptoms.

***
## Approach
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.example.com/my great page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease%20prediction%20using%20machine%20learning/data">dataset</a> from Kaggle was used for this project. The dataset has two files for training and testing.</li>
<li>The data was cleaned and used to train the Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.</li>
<li>A confusion matrix was used to determine the quality of the models.</li>
</ul>

***

## How To Run 

<ul>
  <li>Make sure that both training and testing datasets are downloaded into the data folder of your Jupyter notebook.</li>
  <li>Run the code!</li>
</ul>
